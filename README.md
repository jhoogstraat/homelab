# 📖 Overview

This repo contains the source of my personal homelab that runs a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 8GB locally on my network.

Secrets are encrypted using [sops](https://github.com/getsops/sops) and a [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) asymmetric key pair.

# 🧑‍💻 Setup

The first thing to do is to use the private key of the root.pub public ssh key to generate a installable fedora iot image.

Then use the ansible `bootstrap` playbook to setup some bare minimums, like users and permissions.

## containers

`systemd` unit files are used to define podman pods and containers. This allows them to really nicely integrate into the linux system (like starting on boot, restart on failure, dependency resolution, etc.).

Use the `configure` and `containers` playbooks to setup necessary system components like the firewall and the container unit files.

*Notice: The `containers` playbook requires `BW_SESSION` being set in the environment before running `ansible-playbook`. See the secrets role for more info.*

## Users

- root.pub: Used when installing linux
- admin.pub: The jh user that has sudo permissions without password
- picasso.pub: The unprivliged user that runs userland podman containers

## 🔒 Secrets

Secrets are encrypted using sops and an age key that is stored securely, e.g. in bitwarden, as a secure note.

How to edit secrets (using bitwarden):
1. Unlock the vault by reading the master password from stdin or a file and then setting the `BW_SESSION` environment variable:
```bash
    export BW_SESSION=$(bw unlock --raw)
```

2. Instruct SOPS to retrieve the age private key by executing the following command and taking its output:
```bash
    export SOPS_AGE_KEY_CMD="zsh -c \"bw list items --search 'homelab secrets age de-/encryption key' | jq -r '.[0].fields[] | select(.name == \\\"private key\\\") | .value'\""
```

3. Edit the secrets file using sops:
```bash
    sops edit files/secrets/.env.adguard
```

## Backup

TODO!

## Helpful commands

- `systemd-analyze --user --generators=true verify X.service` - Check for errors during systemd unit generation
- `journalctl` 
    - `-r` - Show all messages in the journal sorted by recently.
    - `-f` - Follow logs as they are coming in.
    - `-u` - Select a service unit to filter for.
    - `-n X` - Show the last X lines of the journal.
